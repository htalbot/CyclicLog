Template dll
------------

This template contains a dummy class. It is used as guideline only.

The function CyclicLog_get_version may be used by the host of the library to
check its version.

The class CyclicLog is generally replaced by something more useful.

After applying modifications according to the needs, this project
just have to be built and tested with its test_app (if included
in workspace).
